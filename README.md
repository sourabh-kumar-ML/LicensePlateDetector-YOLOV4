# LicensePlateDetector-YOLOV4
Detecting license plate and printing number 
This project uses darknet for detection of number plates of vehicles and then applies ESRGAN on cropped license plate then using tesseract predicts number.
Below is the link to my goole drive which contains the data and trained weights:

This file works only on google colab. So, for working on local machine you can downlaod the weights and other files in the drive on your local machine and then build darknet 
on your local machine. You will have to do certain changes in order to make it work on local machine.
